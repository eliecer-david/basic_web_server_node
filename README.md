# Web server Node
This is a basic web server based on Nodejs.
I use express and handlebars to develop this server.

## Steps to run the server
1. Clone this project in your environment.
2. Add .env file (you can copy from .env.example).
3. Run `npm i` in your terminal to install node dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to init the server.
